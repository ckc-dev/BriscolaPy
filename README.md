# BriscolaPy

The classic Mediterranean trick-taking game. Now in your terminal.

This is a simple Python module that implements the classic Italian card game of Briscola. This program simulates a game of Briscola between a number of players, ranging from 2 to 4, including CPU players.

This was a weekend project by me for a friend of mine, who likes the card game, as a fun way of teaching them the very basics of programming.
